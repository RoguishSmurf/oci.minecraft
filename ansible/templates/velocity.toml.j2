# Should we forward IP addresses and other data to backend servers?
# Available options:
# - "none":        No forwarding will be done. All players will appear to be connecting
#                  from the proxy and will have offline-mode UUIDs.
# - "legacy":      Forward player IPs and UUIDs in a BungeeCord-compatible format. Use this
#                  if you run servers using Minecraft 1.12 or lower.
# - "bungeeguard": Forward player IPs and UUIDs in a format supported by the BungeeGuard
#                  plugin. Use this if you run servers using Minecraft 1.12 or lower, and are
#                  unable to implement network level firewalling (on a shared host).
# - "modern":      Forward player IPs and UUIDs as part of the login process using
#                  Velocity's native forwarding. Only applicable for Minecraft 1.13 or higher.

# Should Velocity pass server list ping requests to a backend server?
# Available options:
# - "disabled":    No pass-through will be done. The velocity.toml and server-icon.png
#                  will determine the initial server list ping response.
# - "mods":        Passes only the mod list from your backend server into the response.
#                  The first server in your try list (or forced host) with a mod list will be
#                  used. If no backend servers can be contacted, Velocity won't display any
#                  mod information.
# - "description": Uses the description and mod list from the backend server. The first
#                  server in the try (or forced host) list that responds is used for the
#                  description and mod list.
# - "all":         Uses the backend server's response as the proxy response. The Velocity
#                  configuration is used if no servers could be contacted.
